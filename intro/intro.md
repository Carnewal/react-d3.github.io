1. preserve d3 flexibility.

`react-d3` is a highly module library. You can not only build new d3 charts using `react-d3` to create axis using `<xaxis />`,  `<yaxis />`, label using `<label />`, legend `<legend />`... etc, in other word, it extends the flexibility of `d3` library so you can assemble a whole new chart using core components, but also `react-d3` support high level components which you can install and create a line chart, bar chart, pie chart... etc, within a component.

`react-d3` combine the power of `d3` flexibility and the data flow, structures, components, virtual DOM, and others benefits that `react.js` provide.
